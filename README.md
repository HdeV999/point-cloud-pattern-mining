Tools for the calculation of moving averages of 3D objects

## install
clone this repo somewhere where you will keep it, then in the root folder install with `pip3`:

```
$ cd moving_averages
$ pip3 install -e .```

the `-e` options causes the install to link the module to the cloned folder, instead of installing it in the default module location.
